## Project Name & Summary
__*The Hobby Logger!*__  

A Django designed web service to allow people to create
and visualize journal entries about their favorite hobbies.

## Project Description

Users can create online accounts to list and track their hobbies.
Hobby lists can be created and journal style entries for each
hobby can be created/edited.

## Usage

1. Visit the web interface at: [Hobby Log](https://hobby-log.herokuapp.com/). 
   Note, the site was deployed on a heroku server and 
   may be slow to load on the first use, but will be responsive
   once the server activates the project.
   
2. You can fork the project and run it locally on the machine of your choosing
that has python and Django installed.
